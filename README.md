## Getting started

This library provides `Arrow` and `Task` implementations in two flavors:

`arrows-stdlib`: built on top of the Scala Future, without external dependencies. This module also provides ScalaJS artifacts.

```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.trane" %% "arrows-stdlib" % "0.1.23"
)
```

`arrows-twitter`: built on top of the Twitter Future with the `twitter-util` dependency.

```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.trane" %% "arrows-twitter" % "0.1.23"
)
```

Both implementations have similar behavior, but they mirror the interface of the underlying `Future` to make the migration easier.

## Overview

The `Arrow` and `Task` implementations are inspired by the paper [Generalizing Monads to Arrows](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/arrows.pdf), which introduces `Arrow`s as a way to express computations statically. For instance, this monadic computation:

```scala
import com.twitter.util.Future

def callServiceA(i: Int) = Future.value(i * 2) // replace by service call
def callServiceB(i: Int) = Future.value(i + 1) // replace by service call

callServiceA(1).flatMap { r =>
  callServiceB(r)
}
````

can't be fully inspected statically. It's possible to determine that `callServiceA` will be invoked, but only after running `callServiceA` it's possible to identify that `callServiceB` will be invoked since there's a data dependency.

Arrows are functions that can be composed and reused for multiple executions:

```scala
import arrows.twitter._

val callServiceA = Arrow[Int].map(_ * 2) // replace by service call
val callServiceB = Arrow[Int].map(_ + 1) // replace by service call

val myArrow: Arrow[Int, Int] = 
  callServiceA.andThen(callServiceB)

val result: Future[Int] = myArrow.run(1)
```

The paper also introduces the `first` operator to deal with scenarios like branching where expressing the computation using `Arrow`s is challenging. It's an interesting technique that simulates a `flatMap` using tuples and joins/zips, but introduces considerable code complexity.

This library takes a different approach. Instead of avoiding `flatMap`s, it introduces a special case of `Arrow` called `Task`, which is a regular monad. `Task` is based on `ArrowApply` also introduced by the paper.

Users can easily express computations that are static using arrows and apply them within `flatMap` functions to produce `Task`s:

```scala
val myArrow =
  callServiceA.flatMap {
     case 0 => Task.value(0)
     case i => callServiceB(i)
  }

val result: Future[Int] = myArrow.run(1)
```

It's a mixed approach: computations that can be easily expressed statically don't need `flatMap` and `Task`, which are normally most of the cases. Only the portion of the computations that require some dynamicity needs to incur the price of using `flatMap` and `Task`.

`Task` is an `Arrow` without inputs. It's declared as a type alias:

```scala
type Task[+T] = Arrow[Unit, T]
```

Additionally, it has a companion object that has methods similar to the ones provided by `Future`.

Static computations expressed using `Arrow`s have better performance since they avoid many allocations at runtime, but `Task` can also be as a standalone solution without using `Arrow` directly. It's equivalent to the `IO` and `Task` implementations provided by libraries like Monix, Scalaz 8, and Cats Effect.

## Using `Arrow`

Unlike `Task`, `Arrow`'s' companion object has only a few methods to create new instances. `Arrow`s can be created based on an initial identity arrow through `Arrow.apply`:

```scala
val identityArrow: Arrow[Int, Int] = Arrow[Int]
```

The identity arrow just returns its input, but is useful as a starting point to compose new arrows:

```scala
val stringify: Arrow[Int, String] = Arrow[Int].map(_.toString)
```

Additionally, `Arrow` provides an `apply` method that produces a `Task`, which is the expected return type of a `flatMap` function:

```scala
val nonZeroStringify: Arrow[Int, String] =
  Arrow[Int].flatMap {
    case i if i < 0 => Task.value("")
    case i          => stringify(i)
  }
```

An interesting scenario is recursion with `Arrow`. For this purpose, it's possible to use `Arrow.recursive`:

```scala
val sum =
  Arrow.recursive[List[Int], Int] { self =>
    Arrow[List[Int]].flatMap {
      case Nil          => Task.value(0)
      case head :: tail => self(tail).map(_ + head)
    }
  }
```

Note that `self` is a reference to the `Arrow` under creation.

Once the arrow is created, it can be reused for multiple runs:

```scala
val result1: Future[Int] = sum.run(List(1, 2))
val result2: Future[Int] = sum.run(List(1, 2, 4))
```

For best performance, keep arrows as `val`s in a scope that allows reuse

## Using `Task`

`Task` can be used as a standalone solution similar to the `IO` and `Task` implementations in libraries like Monix, Scalaz 8, and Cats Effect. Their interface mirror the interface of the underlying `Future`.

Even though `Task` is similar to `Future`, it has a different execution mechanism. `Future`s are strict and start to execute once created. `Task` only describes a computation that will eventually execute when executed:

```scala
val f = Future.value(1).map(println) // prints 1 immediately
val t = Task.value(1).map(println) // doesn't print anything during Task creation
t.run // prints 1
```

Tricks like saving `Future`s with `val`s for parallelism doesn't work with `Task`:

```scala

val f1: Future[Int] = Future.value(1) // replace by an async op
val f2: Future[Int] = Future.value(2) // replace by an async op

// at this point both futures are running in parallel, even though
// the second future is only used within the `flatMap` function:
f1.flatMap { i =>
  f2.map(_ + i)
}

val t1: Task[Int] = Future.value(1) // replace by an async op
val t2: Task[Int] = Future.value(2) // replace by an async op

// at this point t1 and t2 are not running, so t2 will only run 
// when t1 finishes and the `flatMap` function is called:
t1.flatMap { i =>
  t2.map(_ + i)
}

```


## Benchmarks

### Overview

The `arrows-benchmark` sub-project has a set of benchmarks that compare this library to other similar solutions. 

Instead of benchmarking specific features in isolation, these benchmarks generate a long chain of transformations using different types of operations like async boundaries, `flatMap`s, etc. This approach tries to simulate how the implementations would behave in a real-world scenario. Benchmarks that only test one or two operations in isolation are skewed since they make the work of the JIT (Just In Time Compiler) much easier, which is something that rarely happens in practice. 

For instance, if only one or two operations are used, it's possible that only one of two implementations of a class are loaded so the JIT can easily compile to native code using monomorphic or bimorphic calls, which are much more efficient. Once the benchmark involves more than two operations, the JIT might have to use megamorphic calls. The same happens with other JIT optimizations like inlining and dead code elimination.

The benchmarks can be executed using a shell script:

```
arrows> ./benchmark.sh
```

It'll output the results and csv files for them.

### Benchmark classes

All benchmarks are based on the same mechanism that generates transformation chains, but they have different parameters that determine the kind of operations to be used. Currently, there are four classes with different configurations:

| Class                         | Async boundaries | Failures | Error handling | Map | FlatMap | 
| :----------------------------:| :--------------: | :------: | :------------: | :-: | :-----: | 
| `SyncSuccessOnlyBenchmarks`   |                  |          |                | X   | X       | 
| `SyncWithFailuresBenchmarks`  |                  | X        | X              | X   | X       | 
| `AsyncSuccessOnlyBenchmarks`  | X                |          |                | X   | X       | 
| `AsyncWithFailuresBenchmarks` | X                | X        | X              | X   | X       | 

It's easy to create new benchmarks with a different configurations. Please feel free to submit a pull request if you'd like to benchmark other combinations of operations.

### Benchmark results

`Arrow` and `Task` are implemented on top of a specific `Future`. They have considerable better throughput and smaller memory footprint if compared to their `Future` counterparts. When compared to other libraries, `Arrow` tends to have better performance than other solutions, but `Task` is only slightly better. That happens because the other libraries are also well optimized.

## Migrating from `Future`

Given that `Task` has an interface similar to `Future`, it's possible to use [Scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix) to do most of the migration. Suggested steps:

#### 1. Install Scalafix

See the [Scalafix documentation](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/docs/users/installation) for all installation options. An easy way is adding the scalafix plugin to your sbt configuration:

```sh
echo -e '\n\n addSbtPlugin("ch.epfl.scala" % "sbt-scalafix" % "0.5.10")' >> project/plugins.sbt
```

#### 2. Run a symbol rewrite from `Future` to `Task`

```sh
# for the Twitter Future
sbt -J-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m 'scalafixCli --rules replace:com.twitter.util.Future/arrows.twitter.Task

# for the Scala Future
sbt -J-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m 'scalafixCli --rules replace:scala.concurrent.Future/arrows.stdlib.Task
```

The metaspace option is important to run Scalafix since SBT's default is too low.

#### 3. Review changes

Look for places where the change from strict to lazy might change the behavior. See the ["Using `Task`"](#using-task) section to understand the difference.

At this point, it's reasonable to pause the migration and test the system to find potential issues with the migration.

#### 4. Fix deprecation warnings

There are deprecated implicit conversions from/to `Arrow`/`Future`. They were introduced to make the migration easier. Fix the deprecation warnings by calling the conversion methods directly and making sure that `Future`s are created within the `Task` execution, not outside.

#### 5. Identify arrows

As an additional step for even better performance, identify methods that can become `Arrow`s and convert them.
